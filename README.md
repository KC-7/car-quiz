### Features Left to Implement

- A submit button could be displayed after the user selects their option, this would give then the option to change their option is they selected the wrong button by mistake before their choice is submitted. When they click submit, the button would then be replaced with the next button. This would give the user an oppurtunity to review their score before proceeding to the next question. 

- Additional difficulty levels could be set up asking the user an array of more difficult questions. 

- A timer feature could be implemented. 

- Sounds could be utilized for user feedback. 

- Add additional pages such as contact, 404, etc. 

- Consider restyling the website so all content is always displayed on any screen size and remove auto scroll / focus features.

#### Responsive Design & Visual Testing - Google Inspect & AmIResponsive

- Visual testing was mainly carried out using the Google Chrome Inspect tool. I tested all sections of the site on a combination of different screen sizes.

    - iPhone SE: 375 x 667 px
    - iPhone XR: 414 x 896 px
    - iPhone 12 Pro 390 x 844 px

    - iPad Air: 820 x 1180 px
    - iPad Mini: 768 x 1024 px
    - Surface Pro 7: 912 x 1368 px
    - Galaxy Fold: 280 x 653 px - *Note, this is the smallest device size the site has been designed to operate on*
    - Nest Hub: 1024 x 600 px
    - Nest Hub Max: 1280 x 800 px

- Visual testing was also carried out using <a href="https://ui.dev/amiresponsive" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Link to Am I Responsive Website (opens in new tab)">Am I Responsive</a>. The responsive image examples shown above were taken from this website. This site provides simulations in the following sizes:

<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 30%" src="readme-files/images/car-quiz.gif" alt="Animated Site Layout Example" width="40%" height="auto" title="Animated Site Layout Example">

- I physically tested the site on the following devices: 
    - Dell Monitor - 24": 1920 x 1200 px
    - Lenovo Yoga 910 - 14" (4k): 3840 x 2160 px
    - Samsung Galaxy S10 - 5.8": 360 x 760 px

#### Fixed Bugs &#10004;

- [x] JSHint flagged issues such as missing semicolons which were then removed. 

<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 40%" src="readme-files/testing/jshint-1.png" alt="JavaScript Validation Issues" width="20%" height="auto" title="JavaScript Validation Issues">

- [x] Minor HTML Issues were highleted during the intial test and addressed as required. 

<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 35%" src="readme-files/testing/initial-issues.png" alt="HTML Validation Issues" width="30%" height="auto" title="HTML Validation Issues">

- [x] I had an issue where the next button was being displayed below the start again button, I resolved this by correcting the JS Funtction. 

<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 35%" src="readme-files/testing/next-btn-issue.png" alt="Next Button Issue" width="30%" height="auto" title="Next Button Issue">

- [x] I initially used alerts to display the answer and end of quiz results. I changed these alerts to show inside the quiz in case the user has a pop up blocker installed on their browser, in which case, the alerts would not work and be seen as a bug. 

<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 35%" src="readme-files/testing/alert1.png" alt="Window Alert Correct Answer" width="30%" height="auto" title="Window Alert Correct Answer">
<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 35%" src="readme-files/testing/alert2.png" alt="Window Alert Wrong Answer" width="30%" height="auto" title="Window Alert Wrong Answer">
<img style="display: inline; margin: 25px 35%" src="readme-files/testing/alert3.png" alt="Window Alert End of Quiz" width="30%" height="auto" title="Window Alert End of Quiz">

- [x] I shared the quiz for testing and was informed that it was not obvious that the next button was displayed lower than what was being displayed on the browser after selecting an option. I addressed this by implementing a Focus Function to send the user to the next button and a Scroll To Function to get the user back to the top of the page. 

- [x] I also received feedback that when the user clicked on the collapsible window, it was not obvious how to close it. To address this issue, I set the inner text to change when the collapsible area is opened or closed to prompt the user to interact with it. 

### Unfixed Bugs &#10006;

I was not able to identify any further bugs during final testing. &#10004;
